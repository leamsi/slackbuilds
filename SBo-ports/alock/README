Alock locks the X server until the user enters a password via the keyboard. If the authentification was successful the X server is unlocked and the user can continue to work. 

alock does not provide any fancy animations like xlock or xscreensaver and never will. Its just for locking the current X session.

Note: If you want to use your login password you'll have to give /usr/bin/alock the suid bit. Be sure to read the man page! You can set it up to use some other password too.

It has an optional (and recomended) dependency on imlib2, which is available at slackbuilds.org. 

Enabling IMLIB2 gives you some goodies:
 * Supports more images formats for the cursor, including common ones as PNG.
 * Supports setting an image as screen blank background.

If you do NOT want to use IMLIB2 set the environment variable WITH_IMLIB2=NO before calling the script.
