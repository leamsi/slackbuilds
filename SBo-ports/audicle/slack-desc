audicle: Audicle ChucK Audio Programming Language Environment
audicle:
audicle: The Audicle, is a duct-taped intersection of a concurrent smart
audicle: editor, compiler, virtual machine, and debugger, all running in
audicle: the same address space, sharing data, and working together at
audicle: runtime. We sometimes believe this augmentation has the potential
audicle: to fundamentally enhance the way we write and visualize audio
audicle: programs both offline and on-the-fly. The Audicle not only provides
audicle: an amusing class of programming tools for real-time composition and
audicle: performances, but also motivates a new type of on-the-fly programming
audicle: aesthetic: one of visualizing the audio programming process.
