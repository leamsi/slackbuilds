par, the Paragraph Formatter

par is  an extremely well-written  and intelligent paragraph  formatter vaguely
similar to "fmt". It makes it  easy to write enviably well-formatted plain text
e-mails and is also helpful with source  code. Some ways in which par surpasses
other paragraph formatters:

    * par preserves prefixes and suffixes on each line. This means that it adds
    the infamous > marks to e-mails when  necessary as it breaks lines. It also
    preserves suffixes, which is invaluable when  you have text surrounded by a
    "box" of characters.

    * par uses a  dynamic programming algorithm to find an  optimal set of line
    breaks. Most  other formatters, like  the Unix  standard fmt, use  a greedy
    algorithm that tends to generate more ragged right edges of formatted text.

    * par  can  fully  justify   text   rather  than  simple  left-  or  right-
    justification.

    * par is quite  flexible and has a host of  command-line options that allow
    you to make it do just about anything you'd like.

(Above text was pretty much copied-pasted from  http://jmcpherson.org/par.html)

It's main disadvantage, however, is that  the documentation is written in a way
which forces you to understand the way  it behaves, rather than the way you use
it.

Note:   This  package  has  nothing  to  with  the  .PAR  file  found  in  some
Usenet/torrent  archives (you  want par2cmdline  for that),  nor the  Perl
Archiving toolkit.
